What steps I followed
I used VS code 
So, in the Terminal 
First , Install required libraries
(Pip install scrapy Pylint autopep8)
then,
scrapy genspider skincare_uses.py(my file name inside spider) stanfordchem.com (domain name in my case)
(so, the above cmd will create file inside the spider folder)
now, inside this file (skincare_uses.py) I added url followed by allowed_domains = [""]
def start_requests(self):
  yeild scrapy.request(url="",callback=self.parse)
I used start_requests() function so that I can extract data from specific website using yeild
Then Print
def parse(self, response):
  print(response.body)
now I have successfully extracted the HTML data from the website
